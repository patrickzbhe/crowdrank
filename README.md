# Crowdrank
Debates between which shows, video games, movies, and players are the best can often get tedious and sometimes violent in large friend groups. Crowdrank is a tier list maker where people can vote on random pairs of items in a list 
to form a non-biased tier list based on everyone's opinions, without the hassle of having to actually have each person rank every single item individually.
